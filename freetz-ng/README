# Persistence in FREETZ-NG
How to persist `/etc/ppp/peers/wemos` in a FREETZ(-NG) image
By default, `/etc/ppp/peers/wemos` is in RAM and will be lost after reboot unless you include it in your Freetz image or use the Freetz mod filesystem.
Recommended:

Add your custom peer file to your Freetz build (so itâ€™s included in the firmware and survives reboots).
Use rc.custom for runtime scripts.

A. Add /etc/ppp/peers/wemos to your Freetz-NG build:
On your build host, create the file in `root/etc/ppp/peers/` in your Freetz-NG build directory:
```sh
mkdir -p root/etc/ppp/peers
nano root/etc/ppp/peers/wemos
``` 
Build your Freetz(-NG) image as usual.
The file will be included in the firmware and available after every reboot.

B. Alternatively: Use the mod filesystem (for testing or changes after flashing)
Place (or upload) the file to /var/mod/etc/ppp/peers/wemos via SSH, FTP, or the Freetz web interface (File Editor or File Manager plugin).
If you want persistence after reboot, make sure your mod filesystem is enabled and persistent.
